Good day to you all. Here is my project, Analysis of Spotify trends 2019. Please enjoy!)

Context:
Currently, Spotify is important part of the industry. This dataset allows us to study how the popularity of artists and songs changes over time and what it looked like in 2019.

Content:
This dataset contains the daily ranking of the 200 most listened songs in all countries from 2019 by Spotify users. It contains 1000 rows and 17 columns, which comprises various songs and artists.

The data spans from 1st January 2019 to 1st January 2020. It has been collected from Spotify's regional chart data.

Inspiration
What songs were trending?
Which artists are more valuable?
Do people listen to the same popular songs in countries far from each other?

To start out, you can take a look into a notebook I have made in order to read the data, filter data from a song, plot which general view of the data.
